*PATTERNS*

**Goal of the game**

Find as many patterns of 3 as possible in the grid. A pattern of 3 is comprised of 3 shapes which all share the same shape and relative composition of colors (though the exact colors need not be the same)
Patterns are rotation-agnostic, and can overlap each other.

**TODO**

Create web app
Create rule slide
Create high score
